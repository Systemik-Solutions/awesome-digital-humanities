[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)


This is a curated list of tools and services supporting the Digital Humanities.
[Contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md) are welcome!

## Geospatial

  * [Geo-Browser](https://geobrowser.de.dariah.eu/) - The DARIAH-DE Geo-Browser allows a comparative visualization of several requests and facilitates the representation of data and their visualization in a correlation of geographic spatial relations at corresponding points of time and sequences. Find out more at [DARIAH-DE](https://de.dariah.eu/en/geobrowser).


## Document Management/Processing

  * [Giles Ecosystem](https://diging.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GECO/overview) - The Giles Ecosystem is a distributed system based on Apache Kafka that allows users to upload documents for text and image extraction. It automatically performs OCR on uploaded images and extracts images and embedded texts from pdf files. The Giles Ecosystem can be easily scaled to accommodate higher workloads.

## Tool building/Rapid prototyping

 * [JupyterHub Workspace](https://github.com/maltevogl/jupyterworkspace) - The JupyterHub Workspace aims to be a collaborative programming and code-sharing platform. It provides access to browser-based Jupyter Notebooks, which integrate code with explanatory text, and are already used as a new publishing form. Data can be shared using the Nextcloud backend. A single sign-on mechanism simplifies access. By sharing useful code snippets among users, a growing examples collection further lowers the entrance barrier to programming for new DH members.  

## Corpus linguistics

* [CorpusExplorer v2.0](http://www.CorpusExplorer.de) - Software for corpus linguists and text/data mining enthusiasts. The CorpusExplorer combines over 45 interactive visualizations under an user-friendly interface. Routine tasks such as text acquisition, cleaning or tagging are completely automated. The simple interface supports the use in university teaching and leads the users/students to fast and substantial results. The CorpusExplorer is open for many standards (XML, CSV, JSON, R, etc.) and also offers its own software development kit (SDK), which allows you to integrate all functions into your own programs.

## User Guides

* [DH Tools for Beginners](https://medium.com/dh-tools-for-beginners) - A collection of tutorials about DH tools aiming at digital humanities researchers.

## Organizations & Research Infrastructures

* [CLARIN](https://www.clarin.eu/) - CLARIN stands for "Common Language Resources and Technology Infrastructure". It is a research infrastructure that was initiated from the vision that all digital language resources and tools from all over Europe and beyond are accessible through a single sign-on online environment for the support of researchers in the humanities and social sciences.

* [DARIAH](https://www.dariah.eu/) - The Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities (DARIAH) aims to enhance and support digitally-enabled research and teaching across the arts and humanities. DARIAH is a network of people, expertise, information, knowledge, content, methods, tools and technologies from its member countries. It develops, maintains and operates an infrastructure in support of ICT-based research practices and sustains researchers in using them to build, analyse and interpret digital resources.

* [CHAIN](https://mith.umd.edu/chain/) - Coalition of Humanities and Arts Infrastructures and Networks.

* [CHCI](https://chcinetwork.org/) - Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes. Currently it has a membership of more than 250 organizations in the Americas, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Pacific Rim. Our members include humanities centers at small, medium, and large colleges and universities, community colleges, independent scholarly societies, research libraries, and other institutes of advanced study.

* [ADHO](http://adho.org/) - The Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO) promotes and supports digital research and teaching across all arts and humanities disciplines, acting as a community-based advisory force, and supporting excellence in research, publication, collaboration and training.

* [ACH](http://ach.org/) - Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH) is a major professional society for the digital humanities. We support and disseminate research and cultivate a vibrant professional community through conferences, publications, and outreach activities.

* [centerNet](http://dhcenternet.org/) - An international network of digital humanities centers.

* [Digital Humanities Now](http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/) - Digital Humanities Now is an experimental, edited publication that highlights and distributes informally published digital humanities scholarship and resources from the open web.

* [GO::DH](http://www.globaloutlookdh.org/) - The purpose of Global Outlook::Digital Humanities (GO::DH) is to help break down barriers that hinder communication and collaboration among researchers and students of the Digital Arts, Humanities, and Cultural Heritage sectors in high, mid, and low income economies.

## Other DH Tools Lists, Directories, Collections, Catalogs & Repositories
* [DiRT (Digital Research Tools)](https://dirtdirectory.org/) - The DiRT Directory is a registry of digital research tools for scholarly use. DiRT makes it easy for digital humanists and others conducting digital research to find and compare resources ranging from content management systems to music OCR, statistical analysis packages to mind-mapping software.

* [TAPoR 3](http://tapor-test.artsrn.ualberta.ca/home) - TAPoR is a gateway to the tools used in sophisticated text analysis and retrieval. It was redesigned in order to integrate the DiRT (Digital Research Tools) directory.

* [DH Toychest](http://dhresourcesforprojectbuilding.pbworks.com/w/page/69244319/Digital%20Humanities%20Tools) - Guides, tools, and other resources for practical work in the digital humanities by researchers, teachers, and students. Curated by [Alan Liu](http://liu.english.ucsb.edu/), University of California, Santa Barbara.

* [Digital Textuality Resource Pages](http://digitaltextuality.pbworks.com/w/page/68178062/Digital%20Textuality%20Resource%20Pages) - Inspired by Alan Liu's ToyChest, Kimberly Knight and her students at U. Texas (Dallas) keep in this repository a list of tools for text production, visualization, still image work, sound work, and video and animation; includes some student reviews of tools.

* [Duke University's DH Tools catalog](https://digitalhumanities.duke.edu/tools) - This list includes tools that Duke supports and tools that have been used by Duke digital projects. Some of the tools are made specifically for DH and others that can be re-purposed quite effectively for Humanities research.
