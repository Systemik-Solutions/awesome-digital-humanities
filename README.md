This is a curated list of tools and services supporting the Digital Humanities.

## Geospatial

  * [Geo-Browser](https://geobrowser.de.dariah.eu/) - The DARIAH-DE Geo-Browser allows a comparative visualization of several requests and facilitates the representation of data and their visualization in a correlation of geographic spatial relations at corresponding points of time and sequences. Find out more at [DARIAH-DE](https://de.dariah.eu/en/geobrowser).


## Document Management/Processing

  * [Giles Ecosystem](https://diging.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GECO/overview) - The Giles Ecosystem is a distributed system based on Apache Kafka that allows users to upload documents for text and image extraction. It automatically performs OCR on uploaded images and extracts images and embedded texts from pdf files. The Giles Ecosystem can be easily scaled to accommodate higher workloads.

## Tool building/Rapid prototyping

 * [JupyterHub Workspace](https://github.com/maltevogl/jupyterworkspace) - The JupyterHub Workspace aims to be a collaborative programming and code-sharing platform. It provides access to browser-based Jupyter Notebooks, which integrate code with explanatory text, and are already used as a new publishing form. Data can be shared using the Nextcloud backend. A single-sign-on mechanism simplifies access. By sharing useful code snippets among users, a growing examples collection further lowers the entrance barrier to programming for new DH members.
